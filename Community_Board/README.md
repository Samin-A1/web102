## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

For a duration of time, the .map function was not correctly iterating through the parks array. To fix that I simply needed to specify the array name as opposed to just pulling data from the json. This is moreso something I simply forgot to do but nonetheless it added quite a bit of time to the project.
